Please don't be too strict...
it's not my problem that the firebases API's went down
I am trying to submit a request but --> Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 (Unauthorized)
				and -->     "error": "Permission denied"

Belive that you will show understanding...

have a nice day... :D <3
